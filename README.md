## Introduction

Vehicle make and model recognition is one of the most popular research topics in the Intelligent Transport System. The system is designed to help recognize a vehicle’s brand and their respective models systematically and effectively using deep learning. For instance, the model would recognize Perodua as the car make/brand and Axia as the car model. There is a wide range of applications for such systems in automatic vehicle surveillance, traffic management, and residential security systems. Our models will focus on popular car brands and models in Malaysia, including Perodua Axia and Toyota Vios to name a few. Our main goal is to develop a machine learning model that can recognize popular car makes and models in Malaysia accurately which can be incorporated in security systems and autonomous vehicles in the future.

<br>

Our main aim for this project is to develop a vehicle make and model recognition system that leverages deep learning based object recognition through the labelling and annotation of image or video datasets of various popular vehicle makes and models in Malaysia. To achieve this, we will propose and develop a recognition system for vehicle make and model that utilises deep learning architectures. The deep learning architectures used are evaluated from various available architectures applicable to the project, and multiple architectures may be used simultaneously in order to achieve the optimal level of performance. We will also perform testing and analyse the results of the experimental system. Our model is catered for Malaysia car makes and models and can be incorporated into relevant software systems such as security systems. Such a system has a wide range of applications and is easily replicable, hence, sustainable profits can be generated through the selling of our softwares, models or findings to relevant fields.

## Problem Statement
With the recent advancement and development of deep learning, techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN-based) object detection have been widely applied to improve different aspects of human lives. As a result, intelligent transport systems (ITSs) are under fast-paced development to improve the safety and efficiency of transport. The recent development of image processing has enabled many convenient systems such as automated traffic monitoring, vehicular surveillance (AVS) and traffic management to emerge into reality (Lee et al., 2019). Notably, vehicle make and model recognition system (VMMR) is an important component in these systems and hence have gained much attention in the ITS fields. Current methods of vehicle identification such as the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system are unreliable as they can be easily affected by many external factors. Improvements in vehicle identification systems are necessary for the development of a trustworthy ITS system.

<br>

Malaysia has one of the highest traffic fatality rates in the world relative to its population (Abdelfatah, 2016). Traffic safety has always been the utmost concern for Malaysia citizens and traffic accidents have resulted in numerous injuries and deaths every year in Malaysia. According to Musa et al. (2020), there are approximately 18 traffic accidents every hour in Malaysia and out of these 18 accidents there is 1 death on average. To reduce traffic fatality rates in Malaysia, changes have to be made to improve our current existing traffic management systems. In addition, according to the Vehicle Theft Reduction Council of Malaysia (2021) as cited in Bernama (2021), there is 1 vehicle stolen every 1 hour 15 minutes in Malaysia. Many counter measures have been carried out to deal with this problem and a VMMR system is a suitable candidate to reduce car theft related crime due to its potential application in AVS systems. Although ANPR systems are already widely implemented in vehicular surveillance and management systems in Malaysia and have served an important role to Malaysia’s traffic safety, there are major flaws in the system that need to be addressed. Limitations such as damage or collusion of license plates can easily affect the performance of an ANPR system and ultimately cause it to fail. As mentioned above with our current ANPR systems, it is still far from sufficient to effectively monitor the condition of the road and hence a new system is in need to be developed to replace or improve our current existing systems.

<br>

Our primary objective is to construct a car make and model recognition system that can effectively identify major car makes and models in Malaysia. The system will be designed with Deep Learning CNN-based algorithms due to their high predictive accuracy and speed. Our aim is to incorporate our product alongside an ANPR system to perform real-time car make and model recognition which in turn will reduce cases of traffic accidents and crimes in Malaysia. The extracted information from our proposed VMMR system can be combined with information extracted by the conventional ANPR system for improved vehicle recognition. In our project proposal, we will propose potential solutions in building a robust and reliable VMMR system.

## Why VMMR?
Intelligent transport systems (ITSs) are advanced systems designed to automate transport operations and management (Lee et al., 2019). The primary aim of ITS is to escalate the efficiency and safety of transportation. Only until recently, fine classification of vehicles have become a popular topic of ITSs. Due to this, many obstacles and challenges in the development of car makes and model recognition systems have yet to be resolved. Vehicle make and model recognition systems (MMR) are closely associated with the security aspects of ITSs and hence must be addressed carefully.

 <br>
 
As stated by Lee et al. (2019), traditional vehicle identification systems only rely on two-main components which includes manual human observation and automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technique otherwise known as the ANPR technique. The ANPR technique is used in combination with the national vehicle registration database for the retrieval of the vehicle make and model. However, many limitations have been encountered during the actual implementation of the system over the past few years. First, with manual observation, it is practically difficult for human observers to effectively identify all modern car makes and models through multiple screens altogether at once. In addition, Zwemer et al. (2018) believes that continuous manual inspection is not a practical long term solution as it is too resource intensive. Secondly, even with the presence of an ANPR system, there is no guarantee that the system can identify the car makes and models accurately as ANPR systems rely heavily on the condition of the license plate. To further elaborate, ANPR technique can fail easily when the detected vehicle has its license plate damaged or occluded (Lee et al., 2019). On top of that, in certain areas license plates are not required to be located at both the front or the rear of the vehicle which can also cause the ANPR system to fail. Therefore, a more reliable system such as the CNN-based VMMR system has to be developed to overcome the limitations that our current systems possess.
